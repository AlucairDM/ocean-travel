<h1>Ocean Travel Module for Foundry VTT (Pathfinder 2e)</h1>
<p>The Ocean Travel Module enhances your Pathfinder 2e experience in Foundry VTT by introducing tools for simulating realistic ocean voyages. This module offers several key features to manage ship travel, weather conditions, and crew roles, providing a richer and more immersive experience.</p>
<h2>Key Macros and Features</h2>
<p>Within the module's compendium, under the folder "Travel" and then "Ocean Travel," you will find three essential macros:</p>
<h3>1. Skill Injector Macro</h3>
<p>This macro allows you to update your current actors with various skills essential for key roles on the ship. These skills correspond to different elements required for the ship's operation and are crucial for successful voyages.</p>
<h3>2. Ocean Travel Setup Window</h3>
<p>Use this window to set up your ship's journey. You can designate a name for the ship, select the type of grid it's on, and determine the scale of the ship. A base speed for the ship will be set at this stage. You can drag and drop crew members and passengers to create a full list. Make sure to set the scale properly; otherwise, the ship's travel distance will not make sense. It's recommended to research the type of vessel your group is using to ensure accurate setup and gameplay.</p>
<h3>3. GM Travel Setup Window</h3>
<p>This window is where you manage either distance-based or time-based travel for your ship. You'll also need to roll for weather conditions and designate which passengers are assisting the crew. Depending on the type of travel selected, you'll specify either the hours of travel or the distance to be traveled.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To begin using the Ocean Travel Module, ensure it is properly installed and enabled within your Foundry VTT instance. Once activated, follow these steps:</p>

<h2>Important Tips</h2>
